# Build

You can build an image from this Dockerfile as indicated below:

    $ docker build -t rakudo-star /path_to_dockerfile/

In addition, you can specify the version of Rakudo Star that you want at build time:

    $ docker build --build-arg rakudo_version=${DESIRED_VERSION} -t rakudo-star /path_to_dockerfile/

If no version is specified, it will default to the version listed in the Dockerfile. It is recommended that
you use the default version.

# Usage

Running a short-term foreground process with the image will launch a Raku REPL:

    $ docker run --rm -it rakudo-star
    > say 'Hello, Raku!'
    Hello, Raku!

You can also provide raku command line switches to a temporary container:

    $ docker run --rm rakudo-star raku -e 'say "Hello!"'

In addition, you can run a script located in the current folder:

    $ docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/script" rakudo-star raku /script/my_raku_script.raku
